Now all the preliminary works are done. I decided to record some useful resources in this post. This post should be updated from time to time.

* The source code is downloadable in the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/v9.3.3/) or in [Github repo](https://github.com/postgres/postgres).

* I find [The Internals of PostgreSQL](https://www.interdb.jp/pg/) exceptionally useful, not only it explains the important ideas of the PostgreSQL, it also contains source code analysis and hands-on examples for better understanding.
