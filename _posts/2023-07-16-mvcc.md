> Writers don't block readers. Readers don't block writers.

### High Level Idea

Assign **timestamps** for determining visibility to transactions when they arrive in the system and make sure that they will see a consistent **snapshot** of the database at the time they arrived.

### How do MVCC work?

Tuple should maintain 3 new fields:

`Version`: Unique key for tuples.
`Begin` and `End`: Determining when this tuple was visible.

#### First Example

![](/assets/img/posts/2023-07-16-mvcc/mvcc1.png)

Now transaction `T1` begins and reads `A0`, and the value is `123`.

Now a new transaction `T2` begins and does a write on `A`, a new version `A1` is created and set the value to `456` and begin time to `2`.

Then set the end time of `A0` to `2`, so `A0` is only visible between timestamp `0` to `2`.

Then it's time for `T1` to read `A` again, naturally after checking its timestamp (which is `1`), it should read `A0`

One problem here is that if another transaction `T3` with timestamp `3` enters the system and wants to read `A`, by comparing with begin and end time it should read `A1`. But what if `T2` haven't committed or have aborted? In this case `T3` should read `A0`, but how?

To solve this we should keep track of the status of the transaction who made changes, if transaction aborts, rollback may be expensive for large number of writes.

So we maintain a table called the transaction status table in the bottom right corner.

Now for `T3`, it looks for the transaction (with timestamp `2`) that created `A1`, and it finds that `T2` is still active, then it should go back to read `A0`.

#### Second Example

Now let's look at an example when there are conflicts.

Again, `T1` performs a read on `A` and a write on `A`, and creates `A1`.

Now `T2` performs another read on `A`, since in the transaction status table `T1` is still active, it should read `A0`.

Then `T2` does a write on `A`, now we have a write-write conflict, this should be solved with other concurrency control techniques, assuming we are using two-phase locking, `T2` has to wait for the completion of `T1`.

After `T1` commits, `T2` can continue creating a new version `A2` and complete its write operation.

### Design Decisions

#### Concurrency Control Protocol

If there are write conflicts, we have to rely on other approaches to solve this:
* Timestamp Ordering
* Optimistic Concurrency Control
* Two-Phase Locking

#### Version Storage

Should maintain a pointer field in the tuples to find different versions of the tuple.

##### Append-Only Storage

![Append-Only Storage](/assets/img/posts/2023-07-16-mvcc/append_only_storage.png)

New versions are appended to the version chain same table space.

1. Oldest-to-Newest (O2N): Append new version to end of the chain, but have to traverse chain on look-ups. Used in MySQL.

2. Newest-to-Oldest (N2O): Append to head and don't have to traverse chain on look-ups, but have to update index pointers for every new version. Used in PostgreSQL.

##### Time-Travel Storage

![Time-Travel Storage](/assets/img/posts/2023-07-16-mvcc/time_travel_storage.png)

One main table has the latest version and older versions are copied to other table called the time-travel table.

Makes garbage collection much easier, only need to look in the time-travel table.

##### Delta Storage

![Delta Storage](/assets/img/posts/2023-07-16-mvcc/delta_storage.png)

Maintain a **Delta Storage Segment** to record modifications of attributes from the previous version.

Write is much faster for there is no need to copy a whole tuple but only a subset of its attributes. However, doing a read on an old version has to replay the delta to recreate old versions.

##### Garbage Collection

**Tuple-level**

Sequential scans on tables and find the tuples with timestamps not visible to all active transactions. It's expensive for pages on disk should also be scanned.

1. Background Vacuuming

    Periodically kick off background threads, scan every table and find the tuples to reclaim tuples. (Could have separate vacuum buffer pool for this)

2. Cooperative Cleaning

    Worker threads identify reclaimable versions as they traverse version chain. Only works with O2N.

**Transaction-level**

Transactions keep track of their old versions so the DBMS does not have to scan tuples to determine visibility.
