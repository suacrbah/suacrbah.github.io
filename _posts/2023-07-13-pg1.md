Recently I'm trying to teach myself about PostgreSQL. The first step is to get a Postgres instance running on my machine. So I thought to myself, "why not using Docker"?

So I searched on the Internet and wrote a `docker-compose.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    container_name: pg_container
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: root
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: root
      POSTGRES_DB: test_db
    volumes:
      - ./data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin4_container
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    restart: always
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@admin.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: root
    volumes:
      - ./data/pgadmin:/var/lib/pgadmin
    ports:
      - "5050:80"
```

However, when I was trying to run this with `docker compose up`, I found myself unable to start pgadmin4 container. The error message is like this:

```
pgadmin4_container  | ERROR  : Failed to create the directory /var/lib/pgadmin/sessions:
pgadmin4_container  |            [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/lib/pgadmin/sessions'
pgadmin4_container  | HINT   : Create the directory /var/lib/pgadmin/sessions, ensure it is writeable by
pgadmin4_container  |          'pgadmin', and try again, or, create a config_local.py file
pgadmin4_container  |          and override the SESSION_DB_PATH setting per
pgadmin4_container  |          https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/7.4/config_py.html

```

After searching through the Internet, I found this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64781245/permission-denied-var-lib-pgadmin-sessions-in-docker) helpful. According to this [article](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/container_deployment.html#mapped-files-and-directories), the reason is that the local `data/pgadmin` directory's UID and GID must be `5050`. So the workaround here is to change the permission of the corresponding directory.

In my case, running `sudo chown -R 5050:5050 ./data/pgadmin` in my local terminal solved the problem for me.

Now I can make changes to the containers and persist the modifications in my local `data` directory.

To login, use `psql -h localhost -p port -U username database`.
